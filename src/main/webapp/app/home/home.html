                    <p>Meetme is a multi-party video conferencing web application, based on the <a href="https://vidyo.io" target="_blank">vidyo.io</a> platform, that allows you to meet with anyone in the world with a single link.

<h2>Geting Started</h2>
                    <p>Before we get started we need a little bit of information to configure your first meetme application:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Grab an <b>Application ID</b> and <b>Developer Key</b> from your <a href="https://developer.vidyo.io/dashboard#tab_apikey" target="_blank">API Key</a>'s. They are used to create tokens automatically and will always remain hidden.</li>
                        <li>Create a <a href="/#/application/new">Application</a> with an Application ID (domain) and Developer Key from vidyo.io.</li>
                        <li>Create a <a href="/#/meeting/new">Meeting</a> for a given Application.</li>
                        <li>Try out the meeting link by clicking the Launch button.</li>
                        <li>Invite others with the meeting link you just created.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your vidyo.io Application ID and Developer Key are kept private at all times.</li>
                        <li>The links are are not guessable so no one can use your minutes without knowing the specific meeting link. Delete meeting links once a meeting is over for the greatest security.</li>
                        <li>If you need more features than those available, this application is open-source and you can modify it as you need on <a href="https://github.com/Vidyo/meetme-web-app-java">GitHub</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
